# Getting Started

So, you wanna do Illumination, heres how get started in 5 Easy Stepsâ„¢.

1. **Find a lightbulb**, your idea needs to be something *requires* hardware, a backend, and a website. For example: An [ESP32-based pager](/submissions/esp32-pager/esp32-pager.md).
- [x] uses hardware to display/read messages
- [x] uses a backend to send messages and recieve read updates
- [x] uses a website to send messages and view updates on those messages.

2. **Pick your poision**, you need to plan out your project, choose what you want to focus on, either hardware, or software, you are allocated by default $20 for parts, and $10 for cloud credits, $10 are left for advanced projects, if your project is advanced enough, you will get to **choose** between either more parts, or more credits.

3. **Get a shovel**, after doing both steps, go look at how to [submit](/docs/SUBMIT.md), and follow the pre-submission steps there.

4. **Start digging**, make sure you have followed step 3 thoroughly. After doing that, see [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTb7lteO1mcMLg6FjuQIOa8-3fBaly3BfqTqTcUgl8XXOedUktOt_cHmkgv8I7L14bs1DHTXLcBea1n/pub) for how to do this. It is the single *best* resource to follow for your project, and should used as the source of truth for most things. **TO QUALIFY FOR THIS YSWS YOU NEED TO INSTALL HACKATIME, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT https://hackatime.hackclub.com**
