# Getting Started

So, you wanna do Illumination? Here's how to get started in 5 Easy Stepsâ„¢.

1. **Find a lightbulb.** Your idea needs to be something that *requires* hardware, a backend, and a website. For example, an [ESP32-based pager](https://github.com/dropalltables/esp32-pager). This pager satisfies the requirements by:
- [x] uses hardware to display/read messages
- [x] uses a backend to send messages and receive read updates
- [x] uses a website to send messages and view updates on those messages.

2. **Pick your poison:** You need to plan out your project and choose what you want to focus on: either hardware or software. By default, you are allocated $10 for parts + shipping, plus $10 for cloud credits. If your project is advanced enough, you can get an extra $10, which you can choose to put towards either **more parts** or **more credits**. If you do not need the extra parts, do not select the **extra parts** option, as this can cause your project to be rejected.

3. **Get a shovel:** After completing steps 1 and 2, look at [this guide](/docs/SUBMIT.md) and follow the pre-submission steps.

4. **Start digging.** Make sure you have followed step 3 thoroughly. After doing that, see [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTb7lteO1mcMLg6FjuQIOa8-3fBaly3BfqTqTcUgl8XXOedUktOt_cHmkgv8I7L14bs1DHTXLcBea1n/pub) for how to complete this YSWS. It is the single *best* resource to follow for your project, and should be used as the source of truth for most things. **TO QUALIFY FOR THIS YSWS YOU NEED TO INSTALL HACKATIME, PLEASE FOLLOW THE INSTRUCTIONS AT https://hackatime.hackclub.com!!!**
